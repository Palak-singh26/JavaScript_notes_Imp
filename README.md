# JavaScript Array Methods – map, filter, reduce (with Polyfills)


1. Native use of `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`
2. Hand‑written polyfills for each method
3. `map` vs `forEach`
4. Six practice problems on student data

All examples are self‑contained in *`app.js`*

## Quick reference

| Method   | Creates a new array? | Core idea                                   |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `map`    | Yes                  | Transform every element                     |
| `filter` | Yes                  | Keep elements that pass a truthy test       |
| `reduce` | No (any value)       | Accumulate to a single result               |

### Method signatures

```js
array.map((value, index, array) => newValue)
array.filter((value, index, array) => Boolean)
array.reduce((acc, value, index, array) => newAcc, initialValue)

|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Declaration vs Expression   | Declarations are hoisted, expressions are not.                                               |
| First-Class Functions       | Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. |
| IIFE                        | `(function() { ... })();` Runs immediately, avoids polluting global scope.                   |
| Closure                     | An inner function retains access to outer variables even after the outer function completes. |
| Hoisting                    | Declarations hoisted with full definition; `var` is hoisted as `undefined`.                 |
| Rest vs Spread              | `...args` gathers parameters; `f(...arr)` spreads them.                                     |
| Arrow vs Regular Functions  | Arrow functions have no `this` or `arguments`, and use concise syntax.                      |

## 1. Event Propagation

Event propagation defines **how events travel** through the DOM tree (capture → target → bubble).
It determines the order in which handlers fire when elements are nested.

---

## 2. Event Bubbling

const div    = document.getElementById("Div");
const form   = document.getElementById("Form");
const button = document.getElementById("Button");

div.addEventListener   ("click", () => alert("DIV BLOCK"));
form.addEventListener  ("click", () => alert("FORM BLOCK"));
button.addEventListener("click", () => alert("BUTTON BLOCK"));

|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Currying                 | Transforming `f(a, b)` to `f(a)(b)` — a function returning another function |
| Arity                    | Number of arguments a function expects                                      |
| Partial Application      | Fixing some arguments of a function and returning a new one                 |
| Infinite Currying        | A function that keeps returning another function until a base case is met   |
| curry() utility          | Custom implementation to transform any multi-arg function to curried form   |

---

## ⚙️ Usage Examples

```js
// Basic currying
function sum(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return function (c) {
      return a + b + c;
    };
  };
}

console.log(sum(2)(6)(1)); // 9

## ❓ 1. What is Event Propagation?

**Event propagation** is the process that defines how events flow through the DOM.  
It determines the order in which elements receive the event: from top to bottom (capturing) or bottom to top (bubbling).

---

## ❓ 2. Event Bubbling

**Event bubbling** means the event starts at the target element and moves **upward** through its ancestors.

```js
div.addEventListener("click", () => alert("DIV BLOCK"));
form.addEventListener("click", () => alert("FORM BLOCK"));
button.addEventListener("click", () => alert("BUTTON BLOCK"));

## ❓ What is a Promise?
A **Promise** in JavaScript represents a value that may be available now, or in the future, or never. It helps manage asynchronous operations more cleanly than callbacks.

```js
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // async task
});
```

---

## 🕐 Synchronous vs Asynchronous

### Synchronous Example

```js
console.log("start");
console.log("subscribe to Palak's channel");
console.log("finish");
```

### Asynchronous Example

```js
console.log("subscribe to Palak's channel");
setTimeout(() => console.log("hellooooooo"), 0);
console.log("finish");
```

---

## 🔁 Callback Hell

```js
function hallchall(rishtedar, cb) {
  setTimeout(() => cb(`Pasand karo ${rishtedar}`), 1000);
}
function aaoristedar(video, cb) {
  setTimeout(() => cb(`AAIYE ghar pr ${video}`), 1000);
}
function jaoristedar(image, cb) {
  setTimeout(() => cb(`Bhej denge sare ${image}`), 1000);
}
```

---

## ✅ Creating Promises
```js
function important(username) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    resolve(`Subscribe to ${username}`);
  });
}
```

---

## 🔗 Promise Chaining

```js
important("Palak's channel")
  .then(res => console.log(res))
  .then(() => like("video"))
  .then(res => console.log(res))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));
```---

## 🔗 Promise Combinators

### 1. `Promise.all`

Resolves all or rejects on the first rejection.

### 2. `Promise.race`

Returns the first resolved or rejected promise.

### 3. `Promise.allSettled`

Returns status + result for all promises.

### 4. `Promise.any`

Returns first **fulfilled** promise. Rejects only if **all** promises reject.

 # 🔁 Debouncing and Throttling Practice – JavaScript

This project demonstrates the difference between **debouncing** and **throttling** using JavaScript. It's designed to help you understand how event-limiting techniques work in real-world UI situations like button clicks.

---

## 📌 What’s Covered

### ✅ Debouncing
- Waits for **user inactivity** before executing a function.
- Used in:
  - Search inputs
  - Resize events
  - Button click optimization

### ✅ Throttling
- Limits how often a function executes over time, regardless of frequency.
- Used in:
  - Scroll events
  - Repeated click handling
  - Window resizing

---

## 💡 What You’ll Learn

| Question | What It Solves | Method Used |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Q1 | Show total button clicks immediately, trigger action after 800ms of no clicks | `_.debounce` |
| Q2 | Show total button clicks, throttle action to run once every 800ms | `_.throttle` |
| Q3 | Custom debounce implementation (without Lodash) | `mydebounced()` |
| Q4 | Custom throttle implementation (without Lodash) | `mythrottle()` |
